# Vladimirs's dotfiles

This repo is mostly for me but you're welcome.

My basic new machine setup is captured in `setup-a-new-machine.sh` which adds homebrew, z, nave, etc.

## private config

Toss it into a file called `.extra` which you do not commit to this repo and just keep in your `~/`

####  Automatic config
* `.vimrc`, `.vim` - vim config, obv.

#### shell environment
* `.aliases`
* `.bash_profile`
* `.bash_prompt`
* `.bashrc`
* `.exports`
* `.functions`
* `.extra` - not included, explained above

#### manual run
* `setup-a-new-machine.sh` - random apps i need installed

#### git, brah
* `.git`
* `.gitattributes`
* `.gitconfig`
* `.gitignore`

* `.inputrc` - config for bash readline


To update later on, just run the sync again.
